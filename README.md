# CyberArk_EPM_Postman_Collection
The CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager Web Services enable you to automate tasks that are usually performed manually in the EPM console. Full documentation for EPM can be found at https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/EPM/Latest/en/Content/Resources/_TopNav/cc_Home.htm. This Postman Collection can be used with the SaaS and on-prem versions of Endpoint Privilege Manager.

## SDK Supported Platforms
The EPM Web Services SDK is a RESTful API that can be invoked by any RESTful client for various programming and scripting environments, including Java, C#, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby.

## Using the EPM Web Services SDK
The EPM Web Services SDK enables you to perform activities on EPM objects via a REST Web Service interface. Each EPM object has its own URL path in the EPM website that can be accessed using the relevant HTTP/S request verb.
